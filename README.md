This project allows you to create a simple text-to-speech reader using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Users can enter text into a textarea and click the "Read" button to have the text spoken aloud by the browser. Here are the steps to set up and run the project:

1. Download the project files from the provided source.

2. Extract the downloaded files to a directory of your choice.

3. Open the "index.html" file in a modern web browser.

4. Enter the text you want to be read into the textarea.

5. Click the "Read" button to hear the text spoken aloud.

Note: Please make sure your web browser supports the Speech Synthesis API. Some older browsers may not support this feature.

Enjoy using the Text-to-Speech Reader!
